## Supplying the Local Grocery Store from the Surrounding Farmers Markets (Farm to Table Aisle) ##

I realized that the following can be deducted from the USDA Farmers Markets (whole country) database: 

- Frequency of the day of the week the market is set up. 
- The seasonality 
- Availability of Organics 
- Availability of Benefits Programs 
- Distribution of Categories

I narrowed the database to work with farmers markets in New York only, in the 5 boroughs (143 farms/rows). This allows for specificity and the reduction of data given the 70+ columns. 

Given a grocery market (first market is in zip code 11215: the highest income in Brooklyn borough), I am working on a pilot program that will: 
- Select the first FM according to distance from Grocery Store (GS1) 
- Given the day of the week FM1 is set up, add a FM2 that will bring the percentage of categories covered up. 
- Give a percentage for the organics with the addition of FM2 and also benefits availability.  
- Possibly bring in FM3 + FM4. 
- Now move onto Day2 and execute the same. 
- After Day 1-7 covered, try a GS2 to see how it scales across boroughs.
